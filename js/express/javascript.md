Create a `.env` file from the `.env.template` and fill in your specific details such as database connection and JWT
secret.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: The source directory for all application code.
    - `config/`: Contains configuration files.
    - `controllers/`: Contains controllers for handling HTTP requests.
    - `models/`: Contains data models for the application.
    - `routes/`: Contains route definitions.

- **Nodemon**: A tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application
  when file changes in the directory are detected. Use the following command to run Nodemon:

```bash 
  npm run dev
```

- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent code style. Run the following command to use
  Prettier:

```bash

```

## Usage

To start the server, you can use:

```bash
